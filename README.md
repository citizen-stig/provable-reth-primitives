# RISC0 provable reth-primitives

## Quick Start

First, make sure [rustup] is installed. The
[`rust-toolchain.toml`][rust-toolchain] file will be used by `cargo` to
automatically install the correct version.

```bash
make install-risc0-toolchain
```

To build all methods and execute the method within the zkVM, run the following
command:


```bash
RUST_LOG="info" RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 cargo run
```


## Directory Structure

It is possible to organize the files for these components in various ways.
However, in this starter template we use a standard directory structure for zkVM
applications, which we think is a good starting point for your applications.

```text

├── host

│       └── main.rs                    <-- [Host code goes here]
└── methods
